# Form Builder (WIP)

The initial plan was to built a form builder which can take in json data as well. But I was only able to create the form using UI in the given time limit. The user can view in real time what fields they are adding or editing and how they will appear in the form.

The actual form creation functionality is under construction as of now.

This tool uses Redux for state management.

To run this app:

1. Clone this repository
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'npm start'
